> Source code of this package was transferred from [avto-dev/roadrunner-laravel](https://github.com/avto-dev/roadrunner-laravel) package by its author. Release `v3.3.0` are same in both packages. Any future releases will be published in this repository _(previous package was abandoned)_.

Easy way for connecting [RoadRunner][roadrunner] and [Laravel][laravel] applications.

## Installation

Make sure that [RR binary file][roadrunner-binary-releases] already installed on your system (or docker image). Require this package with composer using next command:

```shell script
$ composer require spiral/roadrunner-laravel "^4.0"
```

> Installed `composer` is required ([how to install composer][getcomposer]).

After that you can "publish" package configuration file (`./config/roadrunner.php`) using next command:

```shell script
$ php ./artisan vendor:publish --provider='Spiral\RoadRunnerLaravel\ServiceProvider' --tag=config
```

**Important**: despite the fact that worker allows you to refresh application instance on each HTTP request _(if worker started with option `--refresh-app`, eg.: `php ./vendor/bin/rr-worker start --refresh-app`)_, we strongly recommend avoiding this for performance reasons. Large applications can be hard to integrate with RoadRunner _(you must decide which of service providers must be reloaded on each request, avoid "static optimization" in some cases)_, but it's worth it.

### Upgrading guide (`v3.x` &rarr; `v4.x`)

- Update current package in your application:
  - `composer remove spiral/roadrunner-laravel`
  - `composer require spiral/roadrunner-laravel "^4.0"`
- Update your `.rr.yaml` config (take a look for sample [here][roadrunner_config]) - a lot of options was changed
  - Optionally change relay to socket or TCP port:
    > ```yaml
    > server:
    >   command: "php ./vendor/bin/rr-worker start --relay-dsn unix:///var/run/rr-rpc.sock"
    >   relay: "unix:///var/run/rr-rpc.sock"
    > ```
- Update RR binary file (using [`roadrunner-cli`][roadrunner-cli] or download from [binary releases][roadrunner-binary-releases] page) up to `v2.x`
- Update RoadRunner starting (`rr serve ...`) flags - `-v` and `-d` must be not used anymore
- In your application code replace `Spiral\RoadRunner\PSR7Client` with `Spiral\RoadRunner\Http\PSR7Worker`

## Usage

After package installation you can use provided "binary" file as RoadRunner worker: `./vendor/bin/rr-worker`. This worker allows you to interact with incoming requests and outgoing responses using [laravel events system][laravel_events]. Event contains:

Event classname              | Application object | HTTP server request | HTTP request | HTTP response | Exception
---------------------------- | :----------------: | :-----------------: | :----------: | :-----------: | :-------:
`BeforeLoopStartedEvent`     |          ✔         |                     |              |               |
`BeforeLoopIterationEvent`   |          ✔         |          ✔          |              |               |
`BeforeRequestHandlingEvent` |          ✔         |                     |       ✔      |               |
`AfterRequestHandlingEvent`  |          ✔         |                     |       ✔      |       ✔       |
`AfterLoopIterationEvent`    |          ✔         |                     |       ✔      |       ✔       |
`AfterLoopStoppedEvent`      |          ✔         |                     |              |               |
`LoopErrorOccurredEvent`     |          ✔         |          ✔          |              |               |     ✔

Simple `.rr.yaml` config example ([full example can be found here][roadrunner_config]):

> For `windows` path must be full (eg.: `php vendor/spiral/roadrunner-laravel/bin/rr-worker start`)

```yaml
server:
  command: "php ./vendor/bin/rr-worker start --relay-dsn unix:///var/run/rr-rpc.sock"
  relay: "unix:///var/run/rr-rpc.sock"

http:
  address: 0.0.0.0:8080
  middleware: ["headers", "static", "gzip"]
  pool:
    max_jobs: 64 # feel free to change this
    supervisor:
      exec_ttl: 60s
  headers:
    response:
      X-Powered-By: "RoadRunner"
  static:
    dir: "public"
    forbid: [".php"]
```

**Socket** or **TCP port** relay usage is strongly recommended for avoiding problems with `dd()`, `dump()`, `echo()` and other similar functions, that sends data to the IO pipes.

Roadrunner server starting:

```shell script
$ rr serve -c ./.rr.yaml
```

### Listeners

This package provides event listeners for resetting application state without full application reload _(like cookies, HTTP request, application instance, service-providers and other)_. Some of them already declared in configuration file, but you can declare own without any limitations.

### Known issues

#### Controller constructors

You should avoid to use HTTP controller constructors _(created or resolved instances in a constructor can be shared between different requests)_. Use dependencies resolving in a controller **methods** instead.

Bad:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * The user repository instance.
     */
    protected $users;

    /**
     * @var Request
     */
    protected $request;

    /**
     * @param UserRepository $users
     * @param Request        $request
     */
    public function __construct(UserRepository $users, Request $request)
    {
        $this->users   = $users;
        $this->request = $request;
    }

    /**
     * @return Response
     */
    public function store(): Response
    {
        $user = $this->users->getById($this->request->id);

        // ...
    }
}
```

Good:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @param  Request        $request
     * @param  UserRepository $users
     *
     * @return Response
     */
    public function store(Request $request, UserRepository $users): Response
    {
        $user = $users->getById($request->id);

        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Middleware constructors

You should never to use middleware constructor for `session`, `session.store`, `auth` or auth `Guard` instances resolving and **storing** in properties _(for example)_. Use method-injection or access them through `Request` instance.

Bad:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Session\Store;

class Middleware
{
    /**
     * @var Store
     */
    protected $session;

    /**
     * @param Store $session
     */
    public function __construct(Store $session)
    {
        $this->session = $session;
    }

    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param Request  $request
     * @param \Closure $next
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        $name = $this->session->getName();

        // ...

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

Good:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class Middleware
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param Request  $request
     * @param \Closure $next
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        $name = $request->session()->getName();
        // $name = resolve('session')->getName();

        // ...

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

### Testing

For package testing we use `phpunit` framework and `docker-ce` + `docker-compose` as develop environment. So, just write into your terminal after repository cloning:

```shell script
$ make build
$ make latest # or 'make lowest'
$ make test
```
